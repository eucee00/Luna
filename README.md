## Integration with Arduino

Luna  integrates with Arduino for robotics control and sensor input. This enables physical interactions and local processing when internet connectivity is unavailable.

- **Arduino Communication**: Python communicates with Arduino through the `pySerial` library. Ensure the serial communication is non-blocking and handles disconnections gracefully.
- **Edge Processing**: Simple tasks (e.g., wake word detection) can be processed on Arduino using offline models stored on the microcontroller.
- **Sensors**: Arduino can handle sensor input (temperature, motion, etc.) and send this data to the main Python system for decision-making.

**Key Libraries for Arduino Integration**:
- `pySerial` (for serial communication)
- `Firmata` protocol (for advanced Arduino-Python interactions)

---

## Testing and Debugging

- **Unit Tests**: All scripts must have corresponding unit tests in the `tests/` directory.
- **Mocking**: For external APIs (e.g., Google, Spotify), use mocking libraries (`unittest.mock`) to simulate API responses.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests on each push.

---

## API Keys and Configuration

1. **API Keys**: Store all API keys in the `config/service_keys.json` file. Use the `encryption_handler.py` to encrypt keys before saving them to disk.
2. **Configuration**: Ensure all required configurations (API endpoints, user preferences) are loaded correctly through `config_loader.py`.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Commit regularly, and ensure meaningful commit messages.
2. **Feature Branching**: Develop features in separate branches and create pull requests for merging into the main branch.
3. **Code Reviews**: Code must be peer-reviewed before merging to maintain code quality and consistency.
